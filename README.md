## üëã Hi, I'm Vin√≠cius Alexandre

I'm a customer success strategist turned aspiring data scientist, currently pursuing an MBA in Data Science. With 6+ years of experience in business development, performance optimization, and client engagement across B2B and SaaS, I'm now focused on using **Python, SQL, and machine learning** to solve real-world problems through data.

## üöÄ Capstone Project: Predicting SpaceX Falcon 9 Launch Success

This project analyzes historical launch data from **SpaceX Falcon 9 missions** to uncover the drivers of mission success and build a predictive model. Data was collected using the **SpaceX REST API** and **web scraping from Wikipedia**, then cleaned, transformed, and explored using Python.

The goal was to simulate a real-world data science workflow: from data ingestion and preprocessing to exploratory analysis, visualization, and machine learning model selection. Multiple classification algorithms were tested, with a **Decision Tree Classifier** providing the best performance.

This project reflects my ability to work with diverse datasets, apply supervised learning techniques, and communicate insights that support decision-making.

### üîç Key Insights
- Success rates have improved steadily over time, especially since 2018  
- Launch sites with higher volume (e.g., **KSC LC-39A**) show stronger performance  
- Specific orbits (e.g., **GEO, SSO, ES-L1**) are associated with higher success rates  
- Nearly all launches in recent years have been successful, indicating operational maturity

### üõ† Tools & Techniques
- **Languages/Libraries**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Methods**: EDA, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Classification Models  
- **Technologies**: REST API, Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup), Jupyter Notebooks
